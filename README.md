# Diabetes Prediction Using Simple Machine Learning Algorithms
 

## 📜 Description
Showing signs of sudden weight loss, visual blurring, itching, or irritability? Answering these qualifying questions and more can help you detect if you're diabetic or not. 
 
Model is trained using dataset with up to 16 features and 540 training examples.

## 📓 Dataset
Task: Classification

Data Type: Multivariate and Categorical (natural language)
